# EasyHour App

The timesheet, that's it!

## Getting Started

TODO

### Setting the Google Maps API key

Android: create a `secure.properties` file starting from `secure.properties.tpl` and set the map key.

iOS: TBD

### Re-generate language keys

```
flutter pub run easy_localization:generate -f keys -S assets/translations/ -o locale_keys.g.dart
```
